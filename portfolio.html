    <h2>Hi, I'm Rachel Diamond, a creative tech and design junior at CU Boulder. I've always had a passion for both art and science, which is why pursuing a career in Creative Technology and Design (CTD) feels like the perfect fit. My journey blends creativity with technical skills, and I'm excited to explore and innovate through design. Below, you'll find a collection of the projects I've worked onâ€”each one a reflection of my enthusiasm for bringing ideas to life.</h2>
